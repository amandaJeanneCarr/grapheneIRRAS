# grapheneIRRAS
Full codes written in Python and Jupyter Notebook for all data analysis and processing of infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy data. Briefly, code calculates peak areas and peak area ratios to determined the fraction polymer bond shift as induced by graphene.

Additional notes are included in each individual code. For more detailed information, see A. J. Carr, "Application-guided experimental characterizations of nanocompositefilms and interfaces," doctoral dissertation, Stony Brook University, 2020.
